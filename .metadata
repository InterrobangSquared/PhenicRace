  "description" : "1.0.2 - THERE ARE MANY LIKE IT... is out now.\n\nAn OC race from a sci-fi story I'm writing, put into Starbound for fun. \n\nThe Epiphenic Hive, or the \"Phenic\", are a synthetic clonal colony of humanoids. I feel they're best described as \"Space geishas in flying bricks\"\n\nThis is *insanely* barebones right now, I'm putting it out as is because otherwise I'll doubt myself into burying it forever. I hope to have the ships looking much nicer and the clothes/armor properly drawn when I have the time.\n\nThe SAIL is entirely original artwork, it's a modified thing from my profile picture. If there's anything I'm particularly proud of here, it's that. That being said, I hope to have it looking slightly better soon as well.\n\nThe story they're from isn't currently online, since it's still just some boring pre-writing exercises. I hope to have a side-story that isn't entirely awful on offer here, and if it's ever put online you'll be the first to know.\n\n\n\n\nI used DrPvtSkittles' race template for this. It was insanely helpful. You can find that at https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1206462931\nI really do have to thank him for the template twice, since this wouldn't have been done without his heavy lifting.\n\nMost of the hairstyles are modified versions of default hairstyles, and the ships use the Hylotl layout since that layout seems well-liked.\n\nFeel free to patch this for compatibility, but please do link back here!",
